# Tensorflow-2-for-Deep-Learning

This course introduces the latest features in TensorFlow 2. Besides sequential API, it covers functional API and Subclassing API, providing me fully understanding about TensorFlow and its connections to python and numpy. I am still working on the part of probabilistic deep learning just released in september 2020.
